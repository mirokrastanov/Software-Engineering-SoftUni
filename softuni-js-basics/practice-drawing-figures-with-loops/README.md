# Practice Contest: <a href="https://judge.softuni.org/Contests/1851/Drawing-Figures-with-Loops-More-Exercises">Drawing Figures using Loops</a> <br>

## Description <br>
The folder contains solved problems from the optional section in SoftUni related to the drawing of figures using Loops. A few fun problems, requiring very different approach than usual problems. Glad I was able to work through them and solve everything. That final figure was tough. Reversing the logic for the lower part of the Diamond took some time, but I was able to solved it on my own without seeking advice.

## Table of Contents <br>
1. Solved Problems
2. Output Figures (essentially what we need to "draw" via our js code"
3. Link to the Judge system (contains the problems and evaluates the code submitted)
