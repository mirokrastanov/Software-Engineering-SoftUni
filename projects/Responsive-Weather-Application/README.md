## Input & Output
- The app supports both pc user interactions and mobile device touch interactions.
- Vertical scrolling (main) and horizontal (for the hourly preview) - both available as touch gestures for mobile users as well
- PC users can enjoy nice mouse hover animations, while mobile users can enjoy smooth custom step touch gestures
- The website has navigation for easy traversal between views / pages
- Back & Forward buttons as well as keybinds are available as well
- Refreshing is blocked as it causes issues with the hosting. However it should never really be necessary, because the Navigation is visible on all views.
