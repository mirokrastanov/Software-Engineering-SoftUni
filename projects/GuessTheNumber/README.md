## Description
The computer select a random number between 0 and 100. Then the player has to guess what that number is. After each failed attempt the game slows a clue to help the player until they manage to guess the right number.
<br />

## Input & Output
  - The expected **valid input is a number between 0 - 100.**
  - The output indicates whether the number was guessed or not and shows a clue if the guessing failed.
<br />


## Game Logic | Possible Scenarios
**For example the computer has chosen the number 55.** This is hidden from the user. 
|YOUR INPUT|OUTCOME|COLOR|
| :--: | :--: | :--: |
|empty input/nothing|You've submitted an empty input! Please type a number!| Yellow |
|` ` a space/s|Your input --> ` ` --> is not a number! Please type a number!| Yellow |
|`banana`|Your input --> `banana` --> is not a number! Please type a number!| Yellow |
|`12`|Your answer --> `12` --> is too Low! Try again!| Green |
|`87`|Your answer --> `87` --> is too High! Try again!| Red |
|`55`|Correct!!! You guessed the number --> `55` <--| Cyan |

Different outcomes are styled with a specific color to improve their visualization to the player. This should help the player in their next guess as every failed guess provides a colored hint relative to the next step the player must take.
