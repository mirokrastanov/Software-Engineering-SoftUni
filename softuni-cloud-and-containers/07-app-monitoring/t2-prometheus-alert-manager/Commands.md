1. Open `webhook.site` in order to test requests for this scenario
2. Create a new configuration file -> `alertmanager-blackbox.yml`
3. When `webhook.site` is running the following `- url: "http://127.0.0.1:5001/"` from inside the alertmanager file should be replace with the instance URL generated by webhook.site for this test scenario
4. Create alerting rules for Prometheus alarm -> `alert-rules-blackbox-exporter.yml`
5. Expand Prometheus configuration inside -> `prometheus-blackbox-alertmanager.yml`
6. Initiate alert manager on port `9093` -> `alertmanager.exe --config.file=alertmanager-blackbox.yml`
7. Initiate Prometheus -> `prometheus.exe --config.file=prometheus-blackbox-alermanager.yml`
8. On `localhost:9090` -> Alerts -> The alarm should be present, but inactive
9. Initiate without extra config file -> `blackbox_exporter.exe` -> active on port `9115`
10. Start sending requests and see if alarm is triggered when delay is greater than `2.5` milliseconds

Operational loop:
Requests -> Specific Request with delay > 2.5 milliseconds -> Prometheus (alarm on port `9090`) -> Alert Manager (alert on port `9093`) -> Web.hook (GUI with result metrics `webhook.site`) -> (optional) Additional mail server can be added as an extra receiver along side the webhook so emails can be sent when alarms are triggered and the Alert Manager sends alerts to the webhooks
